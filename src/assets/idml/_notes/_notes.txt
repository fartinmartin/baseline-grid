Potentially... using data from useToolbar.js we could generate
our own "src/assets/idml/Spreads/Spread_uce.xml" file. Perhaps
there are more files to edit (where are page dimensions
defined? etc.)

We could use this to compress it into a zip with the ".idml" extension?

I have NO idea if that would work. If it did, it would likely
be a BAD idea to ever make a serious document from a janky
template like this... but it could be cool?
